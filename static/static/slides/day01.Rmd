## Why data analysis and statistical inference?

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '75%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/prisonLetter.png")
```

- $26 \times 25 \times 24 \times ... \times 2 \times 1 = 4 \times 10^{26}$ possible combinations

## Why data analysis and statistical inference?

- On January 28 1986 the Challenger space shuttle exploded 73 seconds after takeoff.

- It was determined failed O rings were the cause: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring)

- Could the Challenger disaster have been prevented?
